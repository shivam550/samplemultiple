    <p><strong>Our Privacy Statement</strong></p>
             <p class="privacycontent">Abc learning center Privacy Policy aims to protect the personal information you provide online. It is available on our homepage and at every page where personally identifiable information is requested. Please direct all questions regarding this policy to Mr. Loh Boon Sen, Data Protection Officer at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@lithan.com">info@lithan.com</a>.
            </p> <p><strong>Collection and Use of Information</strong></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Lithan will collect your personal information only if you provide it of your own volition. If you do not want your personal information to be collected, please do not submit it.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">We value your privacy. We do not rent or sell your personal information. When you submit your personal details and contact information, you give us explicit consent to call, email, or send SMS to you to confirm participation at the event, workshop and/or to related courses/programmes you are registering to or registered in.</p>
             <p class="privacycontent">Furthermore, in the course of browsing our site, we may automatically track certain information about you. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you go to next (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. Many other websites automatically collect this information.</p>
              <p class="privacycontent">We only use the information provided through our site to help us improve our services to you, to provide you with the products you have requested, to inform you about additional products or services that may be of interest to you, for marketing purposes and for other internal purposes. Lithan occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending mail and processing event registration. Lithan will only provide these companies with the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. Other than what is described, Lithan does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others outside of Lithan and its subsidiaries or parent company, and their advertising and promotional agencies and consultants.</p>
              <p class="privacycontent">At any time, while accessing our site, you may decline participation in any activity that asks for information (i.e. survey email, or e-commerce). Your choice not to participate will in no way affect your ability to use any other feature on our website. You may opt-out of our mailing list at any time by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@lithan.com">info@lithan.com</a>. When you decide to opt-out, we will delete all information about you from our database.</p> 
              <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p class="privacycontent">Lithan has implemented several security features throughout the Lithan site to prevent the unauthorized release of or access to personal information. For instance, database information is kept separate from live servers and is firewall protected.</p> 
              <p class="privacycontent">However, even though Lithan endeavours to create a secure and reliable site for you, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to or from Lithan via the Lithan website or e-mail cannot be guaranteed. When disclosing any personal information, you should be mindful of the fact that it is potentially accessible to the public, and consequently, can be collected and used by others without your consent. Lithan has no responsibility or liability for the security of information transmitted via the Internet.</p> 
              <p><strong>External Web Sites</strong></p> <p class="privacycontent">To the extent hyperlinks or banner advertisements incorporating hyperlinks are used to access third party sites, you should be aware that these third party websites are not controlled by Lithan and, therefore, are not subject to this Privacy Policy. You should check the privacy policies of those individual sites to see how your personal information will be used by the operators of those third party websites.</p>
               <p><strong>Your Consent</strong></p> <p class="privacycontent">By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Lithan. Lithan may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page. Your continued use of this site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept these changes. You may have the right to access the personal information, which Lithan has collected about you. You may also have the right to modify any errors contained in that information. Please <a href="/contact-us">contact us</a> for more details.</p> 
               <p><strong>How to Contact Us</strong></p> <p class="privacycontent">Should you have other questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@lithan.com" target="new">info@lithan.com</a>.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Copyright © 2015 Lithan.
